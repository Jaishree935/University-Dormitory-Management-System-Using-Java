# University-Dormitory-Management-System-Using-Java

   The University Dormitory Management System is designed to manage and organize 
student information for university dormitories, focusing on both local and international 
students. This system provides an efficient way to store, manage, and retrieve student details, 
ensuring smooth administration of dormitory allocations and student records. The system is 
built using Java Swing for the front-end user interface, with Java Derby as the database for 
storing and retrieving student data.
